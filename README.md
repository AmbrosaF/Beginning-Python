Hi! This project is simply me relearing Python from basics, and trying my hand once more at coding. 
Letting you know now, the information written here was mostly for notes.
I didn't quiet catch that a README, or a Release Note File, was meant for a customer's further understanding of their product.

Eh, important note for next time.

How to Save Code

1. Git Pull
2. Git Add .
3. Git Commit -m "Message Here."
4. Git Push
5. Git Status (To ensure you did it correctly.)

Book: Beginning Programming with Python for Dummies
Resources:
The author introduced a number of resources at the beginning of the book, highlighted so I can easily access it in the future.

Website to Note:
NumPy and SciPy

Important Thing to Note:
The Importance of a 'ReadMe', sometimes called Release Notes Files, and how to use one.
Similar to how game developer use Release Note Files, it's to inform customers of quirks, changes, and bugs with their products so they're aware of such.
Even if it's in common practice to simply hit 'Continue' and spend hours enjoying the product, it's good to have on hand so the information is there.
